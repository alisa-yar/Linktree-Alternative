## How to customize the template (which lines you should change)

### index.html file
1. line 7 - website title  
2. line 10 - website icon image  
3. line 14 - profile image  
4. line 16 - user name  
5. line 17 - description  
6. lines 20-49 - your social media links  

### style.css file
1. line 4 - text color  
2. line 5 - font
3. line 16 - your backround image/color

#### If you want to change the username and description colors:
Let's say to 'red' for the example 
- username - add 'color: red;' after line 40
- description - add 'color: red;' after line 44
- both - change line 11 from 'color: var(--textColor);' to 'color: red;'

## Social Media Icons
Here you can choose your wanted icons for each link:  
https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free  

### Before using:
* Make sure that you choose only from the "free" section.  
* Copy the code for HTML/CSS.  

### How to use (Example)
Let's say you want to use book icon instead of the Twitter icon  

The line under your wanted link contains this line: "fab fa-twitter"  

Then, after founding the icon that you want and its code, 
paste the code in the same place where was your previous one  

The final code shoud look like this: "fa-solid fa-book"
